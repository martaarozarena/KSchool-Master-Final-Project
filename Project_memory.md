# Project memory

This project predicts coronavirus cases and deaths in 25 selected countries around the world, for the next 2 weeks. In order to aim for better predictions, the model is trained with various exogenous variables. In the frontend, the user is then allowed to modify a couple of these exogenous variables in the future and see how those changes impact the forecast. The frontend visualisation tool is also deployed in Google Cloud, where daily scripts are run in order to retrieve the latest data and update the models with last observed date.
