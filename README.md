# Coronavirus forecast in different countries

**Initial note**: This `readme` explains how to run this project. 

This project predicts coronavirus cases and deaths in 25 selected countries around the world, for the next 2 weeks. In order to aim for better predictions, the model is trained with various exogenous variables. In the frontend, the user is then allowed to modify a couple of these exogenous variables in the future and see how those changes impact the forecast.

This tool is not intended for professional use - it is the result of a Data Science Master's final project and hence includes all necessary steps:

* Data acquisition: data is downloaded from various open data sources (cited at the end of this `readme`) and saved in the two main csvs used for this project - `endogenous.csv` and `exogenous.csv`
  * OurWorldInData.org (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus): daily numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths by country form the `endogenous` dataset. The daily positive rate by country is part of the `exogenous` dataset.
  * Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker): collects systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when. 11 of these country level policies have been integrated into the `exogenous` dataset.
  * YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker (https://yougov.co.uk/topics/international/articles-reports/2020/03/17/personal-measures-taken-avoid-covid-19): percentage of people who say they are wearing a face mask when in public places in each country. This data is included in the `exogenous` dataset, at country level.
  * Eurocontrol airport traffic dataset (https://ansperformance.eu/covid/): the number of daily arrivals by country is included in the `exogenous` dataset.
* Data cleaning:
* Data exploration:
* Modeling:
* Visualisation:
